            Hello im Vinicius! And i really do like creating web sites,
            i&apos;ve been introduced to web development when i was 14 years old
            by my brother, i struggled a lot in the beginning learning in
            PORTUGOL hahahaha. but turns out that with that opportunity that my
            brother presented me with i discovered my passion with web
            development
          </p>
          <p>
            As I progressed, I had the privilege of working on freelance
            projects using PHP. These experiences were eye-opening, broadening
            my perspective and revealing the vast landscape of web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast-forward to today, and i&apos;ve been learning the javascript
            stack(React, node) for a while had the opportunity of working at a
            OneDesk system and have finishing my bachelor&apos;s degree
          </p>
          <p>
            As I reflect on my journeyâ€”from those first lines of PORTUGOL to
            working with modern JavaScript frameworks I&apos;m filled with
            excitement for what&apos;s next. Web development is an ever-evolving
            field, and I&apos;m eager to continue growing, learning, and
            contributing to this dynamic industry.

      <motion.div

        transition={{ duration: 1, delay: 0.65 }}
        className=" flex items-center justify-center   "
